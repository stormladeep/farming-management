Contact Section:

The "Contact Us" section is divided into two parts: address and map for each office, and contact information with social media links.
The map is embedded using an <iframe> from Google Maps. Make sure to replace the "https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18..." with the actual embedded map URL.
Social Media Links:

The social media icons are linked to the corresponding pages (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn). Clicking on these icons will open the social media pages in a new tab.
Replace "facebook.png", "twitter.png", and "linkedin.png" with the correct paths to your social media icons.
Responsive Design:

The address and contact sections are designed to be responsive and should look good on different screen sizes. The layout adjusts by using flexbox.

Explanation:
Component Sections:

Each component now has four images and a summary paragraph explaining what the component is about.
Images are displayed using the .images class in a flexible layout.
CSS Styling:

Images are displayed in a row within each component and will scale slightly when hovered (transform: scale(1.1);).
The component layout is flexible to ensure it adapts to different screen sizes.
HTML Structure:

Each component has an h2 for the title, an images section containing four images, a summary paragraph, and an "Explore" button.
Navigation and Button Hover Effects:

These effects are retained from the previous update.
